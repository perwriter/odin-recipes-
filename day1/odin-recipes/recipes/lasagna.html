    <h3>How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step</h3>
    <p>
      Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade
      lasagna:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef, onion, and
        garlic until the beef is browned and the onion is tender. Drain excess
        fat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Add
        sugar, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce
        heat and let it simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and 2 cups of mozzarella
        cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a 9x13-inch baking dish, layer the lasagna as follows: spread a thin
        layer of the meat sauce on the bottom, place 3 noodles on top, spread a
        third of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, sprinkle with a
        little mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers, ending with the meat sauce
        on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the top, cover with foil (tent it
        slightly so it doesn't touch the cheese), and bake in the preheated oven
        for 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the
        lasagna is hot and bubbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let it stand for 15 minutes before serving. Garnish with chopped parsley
        before serving, if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
